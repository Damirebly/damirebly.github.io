  desc: "Illustration of my character Dami (not me). The lineart and some of the flats/color palette choices were initially done in Aug 2018. 
  When rendering it in 2021 I even did the work the way I used to do it: painstakingly filling in everything by hand with the brush tool.
  For some reason. It felt weird to not finish the piece the way I would have done it then, I suppose. While I like going back to finish
  old WIPs, sometimes it leads to situations like that."

  alttext: "A grayscale (with some pops of red) waist-up illustration of a witch holding an umbrella, looking distressed. Blood pours down in the background
  like rain, with other people also in the background shielding themselves and running away."
  date: 2017-10-19
  desc: "The prompt for day 8 was \"Blood Witch\". This is the only illustration from my Witchtober attempt I would consider finished as is.
  For the prompt I imagined a witch with blood powers that was still inexperienced, and had trouble controlling the powers. So in the scene, 
  blood starts pouring down like rain and they are unable to stop it. 
  

  Thinking about it now, since I drew in an umbrella, maybe this wasn't entirely unexpected."

  mostly in two tones, yellow and burgundy."
  date: 2021-06-25
  desc: "Illustration I made to practice abstract backgrounds. I mostly using the rectangle fill tool to draw lines and boxes, and drew in some clouds as well as 
  used one of the default watercolor brushes in CSP to add the circles. I then made many variations, changing the colors and adding gradients and moving the elements
  to the front or back until I got this result I was happy with. 


  The character is a one-off for this illustration, but I really wanted to draw clothes with a kind of
  lattice on them."

  The prompt was to draw a scene from a story which was part of another event on the site. I chose to draw a scene which had the character going through the story (I chose one of my own Goats for this) enter an overgrown, dried out garden outside a mansion and see a broken fountain with winged statues that appear to be crying."

  I guess when I flipped this originally and saved the final version, I didn't notice the signature got flipped too. This happens a lot."

  when drawing this it got more serious and dark as well to reflect the mood in the illustration. I still really like the texture and gradient effect on the suit."

  desc: >
    A pet form for the [character](/gallery/labithuld-human-form/) I made, originally to be used for the pet I made. 
    I tried to match the Subeta artstyle, which I struggled a bit with (I like the result here, but less on the [other one I made](/gallery/porilopin-rabbit-form/). 
    That style has a very thin, uniform lineart and clearly defined cel shading in 3-5 layers. I later learned it was unecessary to match the style, but it was a neat exercise.

  desc: Illustration of a Subeta avatar character I made (that is, I made an avatar that became a character and then a pet). The concept for this character is a cryptid that is not that familiar with human culture and has not come into contact much with it before, but has developed an interest for fashion. I also made a [sibling character](/gallery/porilopin-human-form/).
