  desc: This art was made for a site event on Goatlings. The prompt was to draw a scene from a story which was part of another event on the site. I chose to draw a scene which had the character going through the story (I chose one of my own Goats for this) enter an overgrown, dried out garden outside a mansion and see a broken fountain with winged statues that appear to be crying.
