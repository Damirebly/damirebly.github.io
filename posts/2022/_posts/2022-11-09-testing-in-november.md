So the art files on the front page don't show the latest based on date. I thought they did, but they don't. However I also though the blog did in fact show the latest. So I'm testing that now. There's a bit with the date in the blog section, idk if that's it. the pipe maybe is the sort. I thought it was just formatting the date.. we'll see if either of these work though. maybe I broke it at some point, I've broken and fixed the latest art in other ways several times already. Screwing up the routing, the layout, the hover etc... 

hey why doesnt the markdown line breaks work now suddenly, it works in first new post
or nvm i think it does work... i mean it does a newline but I want all the space preserved lol

oh yeah nvm i fortunately rememer this from earlier. white space pre line css does the trick.
