Hello this is a regular post with a normal paragraph I will use for testing. First I will make it suuuuuuuuuuuuuper long to see how that acts. and then it will be normal so I can use it to guide the styling on the front page. Its not quite long enough yet so here is some more text. what a nice day. for a longer paragraph. 

Link colors... so links in the body of the text, how does that work? can i do.. [lala](damirebly.net) ? how about

<a href="damirebly.net">lalala</a>

oh another thing i need to verify is if a ginormo first paragrpah does indeed just get pasted on the front page whole, or if theres some kind of internal calculcaion for the cut off. a bit later though links first. also need to check in general if a longer paragraph messes with the grid and flex etc on the front page, since all my styling so far has been done with one line of text for a paragraph on the front page lol....

mm ok so.. these links just get appended to this domain. so it probably works fine for say 

[art gallery](/art) ? or maybe [art gallery](art)?

that last one seems unlikely but.. we'll see

i think the title broke something in the formatting of the side bar..

ok the first one of those. the last one gets appeneded.

so.. full link probably yhen: [full link](http://damirebly.net)


sidebar is fine again. gonna assume that colons cant be used in title. or maybe question marks?

images time

![this is the alttext apparently](/images/other/old_website.png)

{% include image.html url="/images/other/old_website.png" alt="screenshot of a simple website, with a huge logo and some images in the middle. the colors are ugly." description="This was up for 5 years, believe it or not." %}

this doesnt have alt but i can add another field for that. why would the caption be the same as the alt text. thats no fun
