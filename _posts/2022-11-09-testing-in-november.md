So the art files on the front page don't show the latest based on date. I thought they did, but they don't. However I also though the blog did in fact show the latest. So I'm testing that now. There's a bit with the date in the blog section, idk if that's it. the pipe maybe is the sort. I thought it was just formatting the date.. we'll see if either of these work though. maybe I broke it at some point, I've broken and fixed the latest art in other ways several times already. Screwing up the routing, the layout, the hover etc...
