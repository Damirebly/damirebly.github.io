A slightly longer testing post since I need something long when trying to figure out how to show only a set amount of the post. I wonder if limit would work here. probably not. It's for limiting the results retrieved from a list. But I seem to recall this exact thing being mentioned in the tutorials I read. It's a common pattern. So it must be fairly easy to accomplish. 

One thing I'm kind of struggling with is the titles on the index page. Both latest blog post and latest art should be the same size. They're both h2s really. But then I have no h1. I don't want to make one of them h1 and the other h2 and then like, style them the same. Maybe they shouldn't be h anything and I just make classes for it. I guess that's it. I mean these ARE headings, so it's not 100% a styling thing... so idk if it's wrong or right to use h1-2 for these.
