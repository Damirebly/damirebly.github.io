         <h1>About this site</h1>
          This is my personal website/art portfolio and home of/showcase of any of my other creative projects. At the moment you can see illustrations I've done by going to the Art page, and read blog entries. I aim to post primarily about my projects and updates to the site, but may write about other things occasionally. Eventually I hope to expand the site with pages for specific projects as it grows into a repository for everything I do. <br><br>
          The site is still under construction, and some pages have shortcomings or are not filled out. If you're reading this the site hasn't actually been published yet, or I forgot to update this text. ooops<br><br>I spend most of my free time playing games, and am very active on the petsites I play (links belows).
